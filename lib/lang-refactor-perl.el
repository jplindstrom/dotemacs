Ask the user for a variable name to extract the active region

Push the mark and then leave point at the new variable
declaration (you'll need to ensure this is a reasonable location
before jumping back).

By default, only the current defun is changed. Invoke with the
prefix arg to change the entire buffer.

Both replacements and the declaration are highlighted."
