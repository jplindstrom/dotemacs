List of TODO items:

(please note the order is top-down. So first item is most important)

* Refactor highlighting, and put it into a separate erc-hilite.el
  This includes variables like erc-pals, functions like erc-add-pal...
  Highlighting should be done from erc-insert-modify-hook.

* Include keyword/pal/... indicators for erc-track.el.
** Make the current indicator tracking mechanism more flexible/extensible.

* erc-command-table should be not a defconst but a lookup mechanism
  like server message already are. Like erc-cmd-JOIN-hook...

* Rewrite CTCP query/reply handling such that its modular.
  (erc-ctcp-query-TIME-hook ...)

* Implement DCC. This requires the CTCP rewrite first.
