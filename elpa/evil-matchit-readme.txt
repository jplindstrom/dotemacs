This program emulates matchit.vim by Benji Fisher.
Add `(global-evil-matchit-mode 1)' into Emacs setup.
Then press % or `evilmi-jump-items' to jump between then matched pair.
Text object "%" is also provided.

The shortcut "%" is defined in `evilmi-shortcut'. It's both the name of
text object and shortcut of `evilmi-jump-items'. Some people prefer set it
to "m". Here is sample setup:

  (setq evilmi-shortcut "m")
  (global-evil-matchit-mode 1)

This program requires EVIL (http://gitorious.org/evil)
